# Project Euler

Working through all the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems sequentially.

I generally come up with my own solution first, then look to see if anyone else has found a solution that runs faster (surprisingly, lots of the solutions in the forums only take the most obvious approach and are very slow as a result).

If someone else has come up with a better way to tackle the problem, then I'll incorporate their ideas and generalise the solution if it makes sense to do so.
